        "description": "The application aims to create a dynamic and useful solution for continuous use, particularly catering to public transit users, including students, senior citizens, physically disabled individuals, youth, and non-drivers. The problem addressed is the lack of specific information and customization options in current transit apps, which can lead to issues such as inaccessible subway stations, out-of-station transfers, long walks, and additional payments. The importance lies in empowering users to choose routes based on their preferences and specific parameters, ensuring a more personalized and efficient public transit experience.",
        "title": "MTA Route Planner",
        " why": "Current transit apps lack specificity in the routes provided to users, often overlooking crucial parameters such as accessibility and user preferences. This results in suboptimal routes that may include inaccessible stations, out-of-station transfers leading to long walks, and additional costs. The significance of the solution lies in addressing these limitations, empowering public transit users to customize their routes based on individual preferences and specific needs. The goal is to enhance the overall transit experience, making it more efficient, accessible, and user-centric."

        "title": "EmotiSense",
        "why":"This project was initiated with the objective of advancing emotion recognition from speech signals, driven by the increasing importance of understanding human emotions in various domains. The impact of accurate emotion recognition extends beyond immediate applications, such as mental health diagnosis, human-robot interaction, and speech-based emotion recognition in social media. By employing diverse datasets, we aimed to create a robust model with heightened generalization capabilities, allowing it to perform effectively in real-world scenarios. The significance of this research lies in its potential to contribute to the broader field of affective computing and artificial intelligence.  As emotion-aware systems become increasingly prevalent, the impact of our research extends to enhancing the emotional intelligence of machines and improving their ability to interact with humans in a more nuanced and empathetic manner."
