            "why":"Engaging in this project provided a valuable learning opportunity to explore and utilize Adobe Illustrator and Calligraphr, enabling the creation of a custom font with distinctive and nuanced alterations to commonplace characters encountered in daily communication. The use of Adobe Illustrator facilitated the design process, allowing for precision and creativity in crafting unique typographical elements whereas Calligraphr transformed hand-drawn letterforms into a digital font. This endeavor not only enhanced my proficiency in graphic design software but also cultivated an understanding of the intricate details that can elevate ordinary characters to a level of uniqueness and delicacy.
